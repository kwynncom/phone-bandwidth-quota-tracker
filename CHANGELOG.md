Synced this code and my web site.
Changed JS so that as soon as you change the quota, the new actual usage is allowed.  
Changed relevant files to /opt/kwynn aka https://github.com/kwynncom/kwynn-php-general-utils
Created .htaccess to rewrite /pquo.php to ./
I'm removing /arch and /arch/pquo1_nostorage.php.  I believe its permanent home is
